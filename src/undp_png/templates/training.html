<h2>What can I do with the Biodiversity and Climate Geoportal?</h2>
<div>
  <p>These training documents and accompanying presentations have been developed to support users in their journey to
    using open spatial data infrastructures effectively and efficiently.</p>

<h2>What is the Biodiversity and Climate Geoportal?</h2>
<div>
  <div class="training-block">
    <img src="{% static 'img/training_portal.png' %}" alt="">
    <div>
      <p>The Biodiversity and Climate Geoportal is an online data platform for sharing and communicating data and
        insights
        about the region. It uses the <a href="https://geonode.org/" target="_blank">Geonode</a> open-source
        infrastructure as a backend, with some customizations to make it more user-friendly. The Portal is perfect for
        stakeholders including government, NGOs, civil society organizations, and local residents to share and access
        information, share project data, compare datasets across different scales and timeframes, and turn commitments
        into action. It does not have the same suite of features as QGIS, however, it is still possible to create and share
        interactive maps, multimedia stories, and upload pictures and documents using this participatory platform. </p>
      <p>The training documentation goes over the infrastructure of the Biodiversity and Climate Geoportal, how to register an
        account and sign in, download and upload data, and create and share interactive maps.</p>

<h2>Metadata Guidance Document</h2>
<div>
  <p>For making good decisions we need good quality data, with which we can build decision-making systems, and retain
    and re-use the data in similar situations in future. All these are impossible without accurate metadata. </p>
  <p>Metadata is data about data. Metadata is information stored in a database, text document, or xml file that
    describes the purpose and creation of the data. The metadata describes what the data is about, when, how and by whom
    it was created, and how it can be used.</p>
  <p>Every dataset can be defined by creation date, name, description, license, quality and many more attributes. For
    instance, a GIS dataset containing some point locations can be described by its name, the creator, creation date,
    region name, its purpose, and its accuracy. But, without these descriptors encapsulated as metadata, it will be just
    a set of seemingly random latitudes and longitudes. </p>
  <p>This document has been developed to explain more about metadata and file naming conventions, and gives suggestions
    for their use in GeoNode and QGIS. </p>
